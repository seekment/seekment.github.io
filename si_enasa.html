<h1>IEEE Computational Intelligence Magazine<br>Special Issue on <br><br>Evolutionary Neural Architecture Search and Applications</h1>
<h2>Background:</h2>
<p>Deep neural networks have shown significantly promising performance in addressing real-world problems. The achievements of such algorithms largely owe to its deep neural architectures. However, designing an optimal deep architecture for a particular problem requires rich domain knowledge on both the investigated data and the neural network domain, which is not necessarily held by the end-users. Neural Architecture Search (NAS), as an emerging technique to automatically design the optimal deep architectures without having the expertise, is drawing increasing attention from industry and academia. However, NAS is theoretically a non-convex and non-differentiable optimization problem, and existing accurate methods are incapable of well addressing it.</p>
<p>Evolutionary computation (EC) approaches have shown superiority in addressing real-world problems due largely to their powerful abilities in searching for global optima, dealing with non-convex/non-differentiable problems, and requiring no rich domain knowledge. EC has been successfully applied for NAS of shallow and median-scale neural networks, while only limited work on deep neural networks. The goal of this Special Issue is to investigate both the new methods and applications on how EC promotes the deep neural network architecture search without or with only rare human expertise.</p>
